A full-stack web application developed for the IOTOPIA 2025 hackathon. This project addresses water scarcity in drought-prone agricultural zones by using a data-driven approach to optimize irrigation, enhanced with a transparent blockchain ledger for water usage auditing.


*(Live dashboard showing real-time sensor data, AI recommendations, and system status.)*

## ‚ú® Features

* **Live Dashboard:** A clean, responsive user interface to monitor real-time (simulated) soil moisture and temperature data.
* **Predictive AI:** A smart decision engine that goes beyond simple rules, recommending variable watering durations based on soil conditions and weather.
* **Real-time Weather Integration:** Utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch live weather data, automatically halting irrigation during rain.
* **Blockchain Ledger:** Every watering cycle is recorded as an immutable transaction on a simulated blockchain, ensuring a transparent and auditable log of water consumption.
* **Data Visualization:** A live-updating chart that visualizes soil moisture trends over time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is a full-stack application built with the following technologies:

* **Backend:**
    * **Python:** Core programming language.
    * **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used to build the backend server and API.
    * **OpenWeather API:** For fetching real-time weather data.
* **Frontend:**
    * **HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript:** For the structure, styling, and interactivity of the dashboard.
    * **Chart.js:** For rendering the live data visualization chart.
* **Key Concepts Implemented:**
    * **IoT Simulation:** A Python script simulates real-time data from farm sensors.
    * **AI/ML (Simulated):** The `ai_model.py` mimics a predictive model to provide intelligent watering schedules.
    * **Blockchain (Simulated):** `blockchain.py` implements a simple, functional blockchain to log transactions.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites:**
* Python 3.x
* Git
* A free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

-----
**Step 1: Clone the Repository and Navigate into the Project**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Gouthamk08/Drought-prevention-IOTOPIA-.git](https://github.com/Gouthamk08/Drought-prevention-IOTOPIA-.git)
cd Drought-prevention-IOTOPIA-/backend
```

-----

**Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment**

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

***Activate it

# On Windows:
 venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux:
 Ssource venv/bin/activate
```

-----

**Step 3: Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

-----

**Step 4: Add Your API Key**

1.  Open the `backend/weather.py` file in a text editor.
2.  Replace the placeholder `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
3.  Save and close the file.

-----

**Step 5: Run the Server**

```bash
python app.py
```

-----

**Step 6: View the Application**

Your project is now running\!

  * Open your web browser and navigate to: **`http://127.0.0.1:5000`**

The smart irrigation dashboard should now be fully functional.
